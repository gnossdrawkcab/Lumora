# Lumora

**Lumora** is a fast, lightweight IPTV client for Android, Android TV, Fire TV, and — uniquely — **Android Auto, where it plays video on the car screen while parked**. It speaks **Xtream Codes, M3U/M3U8 playlists, Stalker Portal, and Jellyfin** — any number of them running at the same time — and merges Live TV, Movies, and Series from all of them into one clean, D-pad-friendly interface.

It's a native XML/Views app with **no Jetpack Compose anywhere**, and that's deliberate: on the budget TV boxes and streaming sticks these apps actually run on, heavier UI frameworks pin the CPU and cost you frames mid-playback. Everything here is built to stay smooth on hardware that has nothing to spare.

Nothing is behind a paywall — the multi-playlist support, EPG guide, recording, and catch-up that comparable players charge for are simply included.

> **Lumora is a player, not a provider.** It doesn't include, sell, host, or supply any channels, streams, or subscriptions of any kind. You bring your own IPTV service (Xtream Codes / M3U / Stalker Portal) or your own Jellyfin server, and Lumora simply plays it back. See [Disclaimer](#disclaimer).

## Highlights

- **Similar to TiVimate or Sparkle TV, without paying for the features.** Multiple playlists, the EPG guide, DVR recording, catch-up, favourites and multi-provider support are the things those players put behind a premium subscription or one-off unlock. In Lumora they're all just included, free.
- **Video on the car screen, over Android Auto — parked only.** Lumora shows up in the Android Auto launcher (wireless or wired) and plays your catalogue on the head unit itself. It is **not a driving feature**: Lumora disables video unless Android Auto reports the vehicle is stopped, leaving audio-only playback while moving or when speed is unknown. Every session opens on a warning that says exactly that. See [Android Auto](#android-auto-parked-only).
- **Optional Jellyfin support, properly done.** Point it at your own Jellyfin server and its films and series merge into the same shelves as your IPTV catalogue (same title from both = one card). Resume points, watched marks and favourites sync both ways with the server, and files your stick can't decode are converted by the server on the fly rather than opening to a black screen.
- **Run every subscription at once.** Any number of Xtream Codes, M3U and Stalker Portal providers active together, merged into one catalogue instead of switching between playlists.
- **Live TV that tidies itself up.** Duplicate feeds of the same channel collapse into one entry at the best available quality (4K → FHD → HD → SD), with instant fallback to any other copy mid-playback; Sports, News, Music and Cinema surface at the top automatically whatever your provider filed them under.
- **A proper EPG guide.** Scrollable program grid with per-channel schedules, now/next info, program reminders, timeshift/catch-up and DVR recording.
- **Full VOD browsing.** Movies and Series with category shelves, poster grids, season/episode browsing, episode-level Continue Watching and auto-advance to the next episode.
- **Offline downloads.** Save movies and episodes to the phone and watch them with no connection at all (phone only).
- **Built for the remote and for cheap hardware.** Native XML/Views, no Jetpack Compose — it stays smooth on the low-powered sticks these apps usually stutter on, and everything is reachable with a D-pad.

## Features

### Live TV
- **Xtream Codes, M3U/M3U8, Stalker Portal, and Jellyfin** provider support
- **Smart channel merging** — automatically collapses duplicate channel feeds (different quality tiers, source tags, or provider re-listings of the same channel) into a single entry, auto-selecting the best available quality (4K/UHD → FHD → HD → SD), with instant manual fallback to any other version mid-playback
- **Dynamic categories** — Sports, News, Music, and Cinema surface automatically at the top of the channel list, pulling in matching content regardless of which raw provider category it's filed under; everything else cascades below
- **Brand/franchise clustering** — channel families (e.g. all feeds of the same sports network) group into a single expandable category automatically
- **Live EPG guide** — scrollable program grid with per-channel schedules, "now playing" info, and program reminders
- **Picture-in-picture live preview** while browsing the channel list
- **Timeshift/catch-up** playback where the provider supports it
- **DVR recording** — schedule and manage recordings directly from the guide

### Movies & Series
- Full VOD library browsing with category shelves
- Duplicate/version merging for movies re-listed under multiple source tags
- Season/episode browser with **episode-level "Continue Watching"** — resumes the exact episode you left off on, and auto-advances to the next episode when one finishes
- Poster grid view for browsing a full category, plus a global search with poster results
- Pin, hide, and "See All" controls on every category shelf

### Jellyfin (optional)

Lumora is an IPTV player first — Jellyfin is an extra slot you can fill if you happen to run
a server, and everything below is inert if you don't.

- Its films and series merge into the **same shelves and poster grids** as your IPTV catalogue, with a dedicated "Jellyfin" shelf on Films and Series; a title both your provider and your server carry becomes one card with both sources selectable
- **Two-way progress sync** — resume points and watched marks are read from and reported back to the server, so viewing in any other Jellyfin client is reflected here (and vice versa)
- Server-driven **Continue Watching** and **Next Up** rows on Home, deduped against local progress
- **Favourites sync** both ways
- **Format handling** — plays the original file untouched where the device can handle it, and asks the server to convert it on the fly where it can't (10-bit HEVC, TrueHD/DTS audio and similar), based on what the device actually reports it can decode
- External and server-extracted **subtitle tracks** loaded with their forced/default flags honoured
- **Chapter picker** and **seek-preview thumbnails** (trickplay) in the player
- Real season names (Specials included) and per-episode watched state from the server
- Password or **Quick Connect** sign-in

### Playback
- Built on **Media3 (ExoPlayer)** with HLS, DASH, and RTSP support
- Adjustable playback speed, sleep timer, aspect ratio control, audio/subtitle track selection
- Automatic quality/source failover on stream error or sustained buffering
- Google Cast support
- Android TV **TV Input Framework** integration (live channels surface in the system TV app) and **Watch Next** row support

### Android Auto (parked only)

> **Do not watch video while driving.** Watching video while driving is unlawful in most jurisdictions and dangerous everywhere. This feature exists for a stationary car or a passenger display.

Lumora appears in the Android Auto launcher — wireless or wired — and renders video onto the head unit's own screen, rather than sending audio only.

- **Real video on the car display**, not a media-browser audio shell: the projected surface backs a virtual display, so the car screen is a proper window with the picture and its title, and the Android Auto templates are only chrome drawn over it
- **Parked use is fail-closed.** Lumora requests Android Auto's car-speed permission and enables its video track only after receiving a successful stopped-speed signal. Moving, denied, unavailable and not-yet-known states are audio-only. Android Auto may additionally close the app when motion is detected; neither layer should be bypassed.
- **Every session opens on a disclaimer** stating the parked-only limit, with the full "as is", no-warranty, no-liability notice in *Settings → Playback Settings*
- **Your existing catalogue, no phone setup needed** — channels come from Lumora's on-disk cache, so a car session works even if the app hasn't been opened on the phone this boot. Direct IPTV and authenticated Jellyfin Live TV streams use the shared playback resolver; Stalker commands and plugin tokens remain excluded from the car list.
- **Sideload only.** Declaring the car category for something that isn't navigation is against Google Play's policy for cars, so this build cannot ship on Play. You must also enable **Unknown sources** in Android Auto's developer settings before Lumora appears in the car launcher at all

### Other
- QR-code pairing — configure a provider on your phone, scan to push it to the TV instantly
- Parental controls with PIN-gated adult content filtering
- Non-English content filtering
- Local backup/restore (JSON export/import) plus optional Google Drive backup
- Downloads manager for offline movie/episode playback (phone only)
- Custom EPG source support (XMLTV)

## Tested devices

Verified on real hardware, not just an emulator:

- **Amazon Fire TV Stick** — multiple generations, from the 1st gen through to the current one (the oldest sticks are exactly the low-powered hardware the Views-only UI exists for)
- **Sony Bravia** Android TV
- **Samsung** Android phone

Anything else on Android 7.1 (SDK 25) or newer should work; those are just the devices it's actually been exercised on.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Kotlin
- **UI:** Android Views/XML
- **Playback:** [AndroidX Media3](https://developer.android.com/media/media3) (ExoPlayer)
- **Persistence:** Room, WorkManager (background sync), SharedPreferences
- **Networking:** OkHttp
- **Min SDK:** 25 (Android 7.1) · **Target SDK:** 36

## Installation

Grab the latest signed APK from this fork's [Releases](https://github.com/gnossdrawkcab/Lumora/releases) page and sideload it. Lumora checks this fork's GitHub Releases on launch and will prompt you when a new version is available.

To use it in the car, also switch on **Unknown sources** in Android Auto's developer settings (Android Auto → Settings → tap *Version* ten times → ⋮ → Developer settings → Unknown sources). Lumora is sideloaded, so the car launcher hides it until that's on.

On first launch, you'll be asked to add a provider — this is your own Xtream Codes / M3U / Stalker Portal IPTV subscription, or your own Jellyfin server. Lumora has no content of its own and cannot supply one for you.

Provider credentials and Jellyfin access tokens are stored with Android Keystore-backed encrypted preferences. HTTPS is preferred; Lumora displays a warning when you explicitly save an HTTP provider because many legacy IPTV and LAN servers still require cleartext transport.

## Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gnossdrawkcab/Lumora.git
cd lumora
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

The debug APK will be at `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

### Release builds

Release builds are signed using a keystore referenced by `keystore.properties` in the project root (not committed — see `.gitignore`). To build a release APK yourself, create your own keystore and a `keystore.properties` file:

```properties
storeFile=path/to/your.jks
storePassword=...
keyAlias=...
keyPassword=...
```

Then run:

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease
```
