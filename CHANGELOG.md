# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Security
- Provider settings and Jellyfin bearer tokens migrate from plaintext preferences to Android Keystore-backed encrypted storage; Keystore-bound ciphertext is excluded from automatic cloud/device backup.
- Jellyfin authentication headers now require an exact scheme/host/port match, preventing token disclosure to suffix-lookalike hosts or cleartext redirects.
- Self-updates require the official GitHub release URL, GitHub's SHA-256 asset digest, the Lumora package name, and the installed signing certificate before opening the installer.
- Plugin and QR pairing tokens are redacted from logs. Plugin sources/stores require HTTPS (loopback HTTP remains for development), downloads and host responses are size-limited, and a timed-out native script can consume at most one process-wide worker.
- CI actions are commit-pinned, and release signing no longer passes the signing key to a third-party action.

### Android Auto
- A real car-speed gate now keeps video disabled until a stopped vehicle is positively confirmed. Moving, denied and unavailable speed states are audio-only.
- Car playback uses the shared Jellyfin connector/resolver, allowing authenticated cached Jellyfin Live TV channels to play without an open phone activity.

### Build
- Updated to Android Gradle Plugin 8.12.2 and Gradle 8.13, the supported toolchain for compile SDK 36.
- Desktop QuickJS tests are skipped when their optional wrapper-java native library is not supplied, while the rest of the unit suite continues to run.

## 3.4

### Android Auto
- **Lumora now appears on the car screen** and plays video there — for a parked car or a passenger display. Android Auto pulls this class of app off screen the moment the vehicle moves, as it does with every sideloaded video app, so this is playback while parked and nothing at all while driving. Every session opens on a disclaimer saying so, with the full "as is", no-warranty notice in **Settings → Playback Settings**.
- Channels come from the on-disk cache, so a car session works even if the app hasn't been opened. Only streams playable from a URL alone are listed — Stalker, plugin and Jellyfin streams need the phone app to resolve them.
- Requires **Unknown sources** in Android Auto's developer settings; this build cannot ship on Google Play.

### Settings
- **The Settings nav rail collapses**, like the category sidebar — a Collapse row at the bottom of the rail hides it, and a labelled pill brings it back at the section you were on. Portrait phones open with it hidden, so the settings panes get the full width.

## 3.3

### Playback
- **Streams the device can't decode can be handed to another player.** Hardware without a Dolby licence has no AC3/E-AC3 decoder, so those channels played with picture and no sound and nothing said why. There's now an **Open in** button in the player controls, and Lumora offers the hand-off by itself when it detects the audio can't be decoded, when playback errors out with no other version to fall back on, or when a stream keeps buffering with nowhere left to fail over to. Position, title and stream headers travel with it; downloads are handed over as a readable content URI.
- Pick a default player (VLC, MX Player, Just Player…) or be asked each time, in **Settings → Playback Settings**. The offer can be turned off there too.
- **LEFT no longer flies the side menu out** while you're moving along the player's controls bar.

### Discover
- **Titles match your library properly.** "The Odyssey" no longer resolves to "NF - Troy The Odyssey" — matching is exact against a de-decorated name, with sequel markers excluded, instead of accepting any entry that happened to contain the title.
- **Every copy is found, not just the first.** A series held on both Jellyfin and an IPTV provider showed only one of them, and the other was unreachable — including the case where Jellyfin had the season the IPTV copy was missing.
- **Tiles say where a title comes from** — Jellyfin, IPTV, or both — and the info dialog names the actual sources.
- Opening a series from Discover now carries its version chips, so you can switch source without leaving the page, and its **seasons and episodes are selectable** (the D-pad landed nowhere before).

### Browsing
- **Portrait phones hide the category rail by default**, with a wider rail and longer names when you open it — category names were cutting off to near-identical prefixes.
- **Settings and Refresh joined the tab bar** instead of sitting in a separate cluster.
- **Back out of a film or series returns you to its poster**, at the scroll position you left, rather than to the top of the tab.

## 3.2

### Category sidebar
- **Collapse categories now works on TV**, not just phones — the toggle row, the persisted collapsed state, and the re-expand pill are no longer gated to non-TV devices.
- **The re-expand pill no longer overlaps content.** Collapsing the rail now reserves the pill's own space above the active list (including above the Live TV guide's time ruler), instead of floating over the first channel/poster row.
- Reordered the sidebar utility rows so **Collapse categories sits above Show all categories**.

### Live TV
- The **preview pane is bigger on TV** — wider and a bit taller, sized to reach the top of the fifth guide row instead of a small phone-sized box floating in a lot of empty gutter space.
- **Brand mark and Live TV tab nudged slightly** on TV for better spacing.

## 3.1

### Player side menu
- **A navigation menu over the video.** Opens with LEFT on a remote, or the hamburger on phones. Columns fly out to the right: sections, then that section's categories, then its channels or titles. Picking a live channel swaps the stream in place; a film or series opens its detail page.
- **Every section expands**, not just the one playing — browse Series and Movies categories without leaving Live TV.
- **Settings is reachable from the player**, which previously meant backing out of playback to get to the gear button.

### Startup speed
- **Cold start is roughly 3.4s instead of ~30s** on a Fire TV stick with a 50k-item catalogue. Live TV appears at ~3s with the sidebar and shelves landing right behind it, where before the app kept working for another 25 seconds after the grid appeared.
- The grouping and duplicate-folding passes are now **cached to disk** along with the category rows, keyed to the catalogue and the settings that shape them — change a provider or a relevant setting and it re-derives, otherwise it restores.
- The passes themselves are faster too: name normalisation is memoised, shelf building indexes the catalogue once instead of scanning it per category row, and release years are parsed without a regex per title.

### EPG
- **The guide is stored on disk**, so relaunching no longer re-fetches every channel's programmes over the network before the grid fills in.
- A stored guide is only used while it still reaches several hours ahead — an older one is refreshed rather than half-filling the row.

### Playback
- **Subtitles off by default now covers subtitles embedded in the file**, not just sideloaded ones. VOD no longer opens with subtitles on screen when they're switched off.
- **Forced subtitles still come on** — the translated foreign-language scene in an otherwise English film is not lost to "subtitles off".
- **Audio and subtitle language pickers** in Settings > General (English by default). The audio preference applies to films and series, so a multi-audio title opens in the language you asked for; live channels keep their own audio.

### Fixes
- Anime titles and the Anime sidebar row no longer linger after the anime plugin is switched off.

## 3.0

### Providers & catalog
- **Per-provider VOD toggle.** Each provider row in Settings has a VOD checkbox (ticked = VOD enabled, default on) that hides that provider's movies and series without touching the others — including Jellyfin. Movies/series are skipped at fetch time, so gated providers don't do the slow VOD crawl.
- **Three new Filters switches** (all on by default): *Categorize live TV* and *Categorize movies & series* turn the dynamic sidebar categories off (genre buckets, brand clusters — real provider categories stay), and *Group duplicate channels* shows every HD/SD/RAW copy and multi-provider duplicate separately instead of merging them into one card with a version picker.
- **M3U providers are labelled M3U/M3U8** across the settings UI and pairing flow.
- **Settings > Plugins opens the Plugins pane** instead of routing to General.

### Sidebar
- **Pin stars reveal on focus.** A category's star is hidden until the remote lands on its row, then appears so it can be pinned — no more star clutter on every row. Newest, Jellyfin and the "Show all categories" toggle never show one (pinning them is inert), in the sidebar and on poster shelves alike.
- Category chip padding tightened so more categories fit the rail.

### Loading speed
- **Films and Series load noticeably faster**: regex passes in title normalization are now gated on the characters they need, duplicate titles are memoized instead of re-normalized, bucket resolution indexes channels once instead of rescanning per bucket, and the Newest sort no longer re-derives dates on every comparison.
- **Loading feedback appears instantly on tab switch** (same frame as the highlight) instead of after the background work finishes, and a cold start no longer flickers Loading → blank → Loading before the first tab renders.

### Cache
- **The catalog cache stays display-unfiltered.** Providers with VOD turned off keep their previously-cached movies/series in the cache, so re-enabling VOD restores them even offline.
- **A failed refresh can't wipe the cache** — an empty fetch result falls back to the on-disk catalog instead of overwriting it.

## 2.9

### Simple mode
- **New "Simple mode"** hides the tab bar so the Live TV guide fills the screen, forces VOD off, and makes Back exit straight from the top of Live TV — for setups that only ever watch live channels.
- **General settings tab** at the top of the settings rail holds Simple mode plus a standalone **Disable VOD content** switch; the VOD checkbox mirrors simple mode and re-enables when it's turned off.
- **Disable VOD skips the work, not just the UI** — providers stop fetching movies and series entirely (Xtream, Stalker, Jellyfin, M3U filter) and cached cold starts load live-only.

### Live TV & guide
- **Star icons on sidebar categories and guide rows** (white = pinned/favourited, grey = not), moved left of the name with their own focus box and key handling so a remote can actually reach them. Child-row indent tightened.
- **EPG timezone fix** — panels that store local wall-clock time as a UTC epoch are now auto-detected and shifted, so the guide lines up with the device clock instead of sitting hours off.

### Posters
- **Titles are outlined instead of shadowed.** The old blur shadow washed out against bright or busy artwork and left white text unreadable; titles now draw a hard black stroke under the text, with a light shadow kept for depth.
- **Titles cleaned of source and quality tags** (4K-AMZ, D+, PRIME:, region tags, mid-title chains), wrapping to 4 lines with auto-shrink and no mid-word breaks.
- **20% smaller posters**, plus a large-screen (4K) bucket that fits more of them on screen.

### Fixes
- **Fixed a crash opening a series from Continue Watching** (version-chip layout cast).

## 2.8

### Continue Watching
- **The ✕ on a Continue Watching shelf now clears it everywhere** - Home, Series and Movies at once, not just the tab the button was pressed on. Local resume data is wiped and Jellyfin's server-side resume list is cleared too, and a stale "hidden shelf" flag can't keep the row suppressed afterwards.
- **A Continue Watching tile opens the series page, not a replay of the episode.** Clicking an in-progress episode lands on its series' detail screen with the full episode list; the Play button targets the next-unwatched episode. Jellyfin episodes now carry their parent series id so they resolve even from the server's resume list.

### Back navigation
- **Back no longer gets stuck at the top of a category.** The old walk-up selected the sidebar's first row - which on Live TV is the classic-layout control, not a category - so every press flipped the layout and Back never reached Home. Back now scrolls to the top of the section, then goes Home, then exits the app, from any tab.

### Player
- **Jellyfin direct-play retries with a fresh URL on a stale-stream error** instead of dropping to "Playback error" - transient server timeouts and expired direct-play URLs recover on their own.
- **60s read timeout for slow remote Jellyfin/transcode servers** so a cold server start doesn't read as a failure.
- **Subtitles are opt-in.** Sidecar subtitle tracks no longer auto-select; a "Subtitles" toggle in the playback filters pane turns them on for all playback, while the existing "dubbed episodes" option stays.

### Live TV
- **Guide rows show a now/next line** under the channel name, filled from the already-fetched EPG; the focused row adds the next program ("Now: X · Next: Y").
- **Live preview black-frame detection is smarter** - it never samples mid-buffer (slow stalls can't falsely kill a healthy version) and resets its streak on each load or version switch.

### Misc
- **Touchscreen declared not required**, so TV sticks aren't filtered out of the supported device set.
- Baseline profile module removed.

## 2.7

### Torrent playback on old devices
- **Fixed crashes on older Fire TV sticks (Android 7.1).** The torrent engine's native library (libtorrent4j 2.1.0-35) crashed on API 25 devices; the 2.0.x line is built with an older toolchain and survives there. Native libs are also extracted instead of loaded straight from the APK, avoiding a page-alignment load failure on old Android.
- **Starting a torrent stream no longer crashes on Android 7.1** - the foreground-service notification uses the compat builder the platform's two-arg `Notification.Builder` doesn't exist below Android O.
- **Torrent metadata is fetched by waiting for peers properly** instead of the DHT-injection loop that starved it.

### Player
- **All track buttons are reachable with the remote again** - the D-pad focus chain was broken between Diagnostics and Record, which made the Versions, Record, Aspect Ratio, Audio and Subtitle buttons impossible to focus on a TV. The chain now runs the whole row.

### Plugins
- **Installing a plugin from a store no longer switches it on automatically.** Install puts the script on the device; enabling stays a separate, visible action on the plugin's own page (same rule as add-from-URL) - so an Install tap can't silently make a stream_search plugin start answering Find Stream and pulling its catalogue into Series.


### Design
- **Complete visual redesign.** Obsidian dark palette, Inter typeface, glass-style surfaces with hairline borders, and a refined indigo/blue accent. Everything from the toolbar to the settings panels was rebuilt to the same modern look.
- **Real icons everywhere.** Emoji tab labels, rainbow letter-chips and stock system icons are gone, replaced with a monochrome vector icon set - including new tab icons, a broadcast-cone Live TV mark, a clapperboard Movies mark, and a brand icon replacing the toolbar wordmark.
- **Films is now Movies**, with a matching clapperboard icon.
- **See All buttons tightened** so the label fits the pill instead of floating in padding.
- **About section expanded** with App/Platform rows and a Discord link.

### Playback
- **Touch gestures on the phone player.** Single tap pauses, double-tap the right half fast-forwards 10s, double-tap the left half rewinds 10s, and pinch zooms the picture 1-3x (zoomed state resets on the next video).
- **Fixed a launch crash on TV** introduced by the gesture work - the gesture detectors are now built after the activity is attached, so the app no longer dies on start.

### Speed
- **Catalog data is cached for 24 hours** and served instantly on launch - plugin discovery and network reconnects no longer gate the fast path, and nothing reconnects to providers in the background between sessions.
- **Category grouping is faster** (a quadratic scan replaced with a hash lookup) so large catalogs rebuild shelves quicker.

### Categories
- **Poster shelves and the sidebar category list now share one pipeline.** Series and Movies shelves show exactly the same categories in exactly the same order as the sidebar (Newest and Favourites stay pinned on top), so the two views can never drift apart again.
- **"Prefer dubbed audio" rows match the other settings rows**, with proper card styling, padding and D-pad focus.
- **Newly installed plugins are enabled by default**, instead of silently sitting off until you find the toggle.
- **Providers added from a discovery plugin appear in Settings instantly**, and the app jumps to the Providers pane instead of leaving you on a stale "Added" button.


### Navigation
- **Live TV is now the screen the app opens on**, and the tabs run Live TV / Series / Films / Home / Discover.
- **Back no longer drops you out of the app.** Inside a section it goes to the top of that section first (a film or series category goes back to that tab's shelves), then to Home, and only a Back pressed on Home exits.

### Favourites
- **Favourited live channels now show on Home**, in their own row. They were saved correctly but only ever appeared inside Live TV's Favourites category.
- **Favourited films show up too** - Home's Favourites row only ever looked at series, so a favourited film was saved and then never shown anywhere.
- **Hold to favourite any poster**, on Home, Series, Films and search results - the same hold that already favourites a channel in the live guide. Pinning a category from the sidebar now confirms on screen.

### Fixes
- **Posters stopped loading after browsing around.** Switching a tab between its shelves and a category grid permanently killed that list's image loading, so everything but already-cached posters stayed blank. Poster loading is also more robust in general: evicted images can no longer be recycled out from under a visible tile, and slow or unusual images no longer fail silently.
- **A second provider couldn't be added on a remote.** Opening the add form hid the button that had focus, leaving nothing focused at all - the provider type cards (Xtream, M3U, Stalker, Jellyfin) simply couldn't be reached with the D-pad.
- **"See All" is bigger**, and no longer the smallest thing on the screen to aim at.
- **Phone: the back gesture works like Back on a remote** instead of closing the app - it unwinds the same way (top of section, then Home, then exit).
- **Torrent playback no longer crashes the release build.** The torrent engine's classes were being stripped from release APKs, so playing one crashed instantly; debug builds were unaffected.

## 2.4

### Fixes
- **Settings could freeze on a routine remove/toggle.** Providers were re-fetched one after another on any add/remove/toggle; a single dead or slow provider held up every provider after it for up to its 6-minute timeout, reading as the app hanging. They're now fetched concurrently.
- **A large Stalker portal could crash the app.** A portal with tens of thousands of live channels plus a large VOD/series library held all three fully in memory before showing anything, spiking heap enough to get the process killed outright by the OS. Live channels now load and show first, before VOD/series.
- **No loading indicator on launch.** The screen sat blank while plugins were discovered and the catalog loaded, then jumped straight to content with no loading state ever having shown - looked like the app was hanging. "Loading..." with its spinner now shows immediately.
- **Removed auto-reopening the last-played channel on launch.** It's more disruptive than convenient, especially on a blank cold start.
- **Plugin pages could leave stale UI behind.** Opening a plugin's page from the Settings nav rail dropdown could leave a previous section (e.g. EPG Sources) visible underneath it, and D-pad focus could get stranded with nothing selected after adding a provider from a plugin's results.

## 2.3

### Jellyfin
- **Whole library now loads.** Library fetches were capped at 500 items per type, silently cutting off anything past that. They're paged now, so the full catalogue comes through.
- **Progress syncs both ways.** What you watch in Lumora is reported to the server, and resume points and watched marks made in any other Jellyfin client show up here. A local resume point is never rewound by an older one from the server.
- **No more black screens or silent audio.** Playback is negotiated with the server against what the device can actually decode, so files in formats a cheap stick can't handle (10-bit HEVC, TrueHD/DTS audio) are converted on the fly instead of failing. Files it can handle still play untouched.
- **Continue Watching and Next Up** rows on Home, driven by the server and deduped against local progress.
- **Favourites sync** both ways with the server.
- **Subtitles** — external and server-extracted tracks now appear in the track picker, with forced/default flags honoured.
- **Chapter picker** and **seek-preview thumbnails** (trickplay) in the player.
- Real season names including **Specials**, and per-episode watched state pulled from the server.

### Library browsing
- Films and Series get a **Jellyfin shelf** directly under "Newest", while its titles stay merged into the normal genre and provider shelves.
- **Better duplicate matching** — a title your IPTV provider lists with a region or quality tag ("(US)", "(FHD)") now groups with the same title from another source instead of showing twice.

### Fixes
- **Phone: toolbar was under the status bar.** On a portrait phone the settings and refresh buttons sat behind the clock and signal icons and couldn't be tapped at all (landscape only worked because the status bar is shorter there). The app's chrome is now inset out from the system bars.
- **Settings screen was showing stray UI.** Home's search bar and the whole Discover pane stayed on screen above Settings; both are now hidden while it's open.

## 2.2.1

- Category visibility, channel resume, and adult-history exclusion fixes.

## 2.2

- Live preview, version ranking, Jellyfin episodes, and provider toggling fixes.
