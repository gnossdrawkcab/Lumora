/**
 * Lumora on Android Auto.
 *
 * Android Auto has no video app category - media apps are audio-only by definition, and the
 * projected surface is not available to arbitrary Activities. Navigation template apps *are*
 * given a real drawing [android.view.Surface] (it exists so a maps app can render its own
 * map), and nothing about that surface is map-specific: ExoPlayer renders video into it the
 * same way it renders into a SurfaceView. That is the whole trick, and it is the same one
 * every other car video app on Android Auto uses.
 *
 * Consequences to be aware of, because they are not incidental:
 *  - This can never ship on Google Play. Declaring the navigation category for something that
 *    is not navigation is against the Play policy for cars, so Lumora stays a sideload.
 *  - The user has to enable "Unknown sources" in Android Auto's developer settings before the
 *    app appears in the car launcher at all.
 *  - Video while the car is moving is illegal in most places and dangerous everywhere. The
 *    picture is therefore parked-only by default (see [CarPlayerScreen]); audio continues
 *    when the car starts moving, and only the video track is dropped.
